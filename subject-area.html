            <h2>Software Engineering</h2>

            <p><strong>Type:</strong> BSc</p>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong>: 3 years</p>

            <p>This course introduce design patterns from Software Engineering 2; will consolidate and develop standard vehicles such as the Unified Modelling Language to embrace consideration of patterns for analysis as well as design; review the current situation and address issues pertaining to probable future trends/various standards (de facto or agreed), which relate to the construction of software systems from pre-existing components; maintain persistence of data on object systems (whether through object databases or by other means); consider the potential for software metrics; consider distributed systems and managing concurrency</p>

                    <h4>CSY2002 - Operating Systems</h4>
                    <p>This year 2 module is designed to give an understanding of the principles, application, structure and design principles of operating systems.  The module requires a significant practical element delivered as formal laboratory sessions in which computer systems skills are acquired.</p>

                    <h4>CSY1014 - Operating Systems</h4>
                    <p>This module provides basic knowledge of the hardware and software components that make up a computer system. Modern computer systems not only consist of just the computer, but also include a range of peripherals. The module gives an overview of all the important concepts in preparation for a deeper study of computer systems</p>
