Assessment Brief

The main purpose of the website is to make it so university staff can advertise courses available at the university within subject areas. There will need to be a secure administration area where university staff are able to login and add courses which will then appear on the public facing website.

You have two tasks:
Implement the requested functionality on the website
Build the website in such a way that it is easy to maintain going forwards. Additional marks are available for building the website using reusable components that could be used on a future second website unrelated to the university or even an educational establishment.
The staff who will be using the website have basic computer skills but are not programmers. It is vitally important that they can amend the content of the website without writing any code.
The product manager has chosen to follow a kanban style development process, and you have been assigned the following tickets. A senior engineer has outlined some implementation details as a suggested approach.































Ticket NMP-0001: User accounts Background
This is a new website we’re setting up. The HTML/CSS is attached and as a basic functionality we’ll need a way for staff members to log in in order to make future changes to the website. Create a page, using the supplied layout, that allows staff members to log in to an account using a username/password.

We’ll also need to be able to add/remove new staff members. There should be a "superadmin” account which can
add/remove new staff members. Normal (non “superadmin”) users should not have access to alter staff accounts

Acceptance Criteria

A superadmin can log in and add new accounts
Once a new account is added that new user can log in to the website and add subject areas (NMP-0002) and courses (NMP-0003).
A superadmin can delete accounts
The superadmin account cannot be deleted
Accounts that are not the superadmin should not be able to add/remove accounts

Implementation details

As there are two different user roles you’ll need to ensure that the roles superadmin/normal user are tracked in the database and upon log in.

Make sure you consider password security when implementing this ticket, there should be no passwords in the code. Also consider building the solution in such a way that new roles with different access levels can easily be added in future

Using entities and an ORM will make your task a lot easier. Try to combine add and edit forms to minimise the work required.





















Ticket NMP-0002: Add/display subject areas Background
[ Depends on NMP-0001 ]
The primary purpose of the website is to advertise courses. Each course is placed within a subject area such as “Computing”, “Education”, “Biomedical Science”, etc. Before courses can be added we’ll need a way to group them by subject area on the website.
An admin user (as outlined in ticket NMP-0001) should be able to log in and then once logged in be able to add a new subject area which should appear on the “Subject Areas” drop down on the website (The HTML/CSS has already been provided). For this ticket the links should appear in the menu and go to a page where the courses will eventually appear.

Clicking “Software Engineering” should go to a page which has a heading of “Software Engineering”, clicking “History” should go to a page with a heading of “History”, etc. That page will then show a list of courses for the chosen subject area. The work for adding courses is outlined in NMP-0003. We’ll also need to be able to edit the subject area name or delete it entirely in cases where the university no longer offers that subject.

Acceptance criteria

Logged in admin users can add new subject areas and rename existing subject areas or delete them entirely.
Users who are not logged in should not be able to add/edit/delete subject areas.
Once a subject area is added it appears in the menu as a clickable link
Clicking one of the subject areas should go to a page (within the standard layout provided) that has a
heading of the chosen subject area. E.g. clicking “History” shows a page with a heading that says “History”

Implementation detail

Avoid using separate add/edit pages if possible. The solution will need to support any number of subject areas.

There will need to be a way to see the existing subject areas as a logged in admin, with the option to edit or delete them.
Using entities and an ORM will make your task a lot easier. Try to combine add and edit forms to minimise the work required.














Ticket NMP-0003: Add/display courses Background
[ Depends on NMP-0002 ]
The primary purpose of the website is to advertise courses. In NMP-0002 the functionality for adding subject areas was added. Once a subject area can be added, courses can be assigned to it.
An admin area should be able to log in and add a course. Each course should:
Be assigned to a subject area. For example “Software Engineering” can be added under the “Computing”
subject area.
Have a title e.g. “Software Engineering”
Have a length in years e.g. 2 years
Have a type for example “MSc”, “BSc”, “MA”, “BA”
Have a description of the course
Have a list of modules that are taught on the course. It should show the module code, module title and a short description of the module.

When a course is added it should be able to be seen on the subject area page with all the details provided (See subject-area.html from the supplied HTML/CSS).
Acceptance criteria
Courses can be added with all the data listed above
Once a course is added it can be added or updated.
It should be possible to move the course from one subject area to another
After a course has been added it should be visible on the public side of the website on the relevant subject area page.

Implementation detail

Avoid using separate add/edit pages if possible. The solution will need to support any number of courses. There will need to be a way to see the existing subject areas as a logged in admin, with the option to edit or delete them.

Some modules will inevitably exist on more than one course. Consider handling this in a smarter way than a single database column for the list of modules with the titles and descriptions.
Using entities and an ORM will make your task a lot easier. Try to combine add and edit forms to minimise the work required.











Ticket NMP-0004: Enquiries Background
There’s a “Make an enquiry” link at the top of the website with a sample form in enquiry.html provided.

We’d like people to be able to make an enquiry via the website by providing the requested information:

Name of person making enquiry
Email address
Phone number (optional)
Course name
Enquiry text


When the potential student submits an enquiry it should be visible to admins once they are logged in. All the details about the enquiry will need to be visible. Someone at the university will then respond to the enquiry via email or phone. This doesn’t need to be handled to the website, however we will need to track which enquiries have been responded to.

To track historical enquiries we will need to be able see list of pending enquiries (yet to be responded to) and also see those which have already been responded to and who responded to it based on the user who marked the enquiry as responded to.

Acceptance criteria

Anyone viewing the website can submit an enquiry
Submitted enquiries are visible to admins as long as they are logged in
Enquires can be marked as “Responded to” and it logs who responded to the enquiry based on
who’s logged in
Have a way to show pending enquiries (those which have not been responded to)
Have a way to show responded to enquiries

Implementation detail

Since the two lists (pending/responded to) are basically the same it shouldn’t require two different
pages for that feature.

The “who responded to the enquiry” task should use the logged in user only for security.

Using entities and an ORM will make your task a lot easier.


















Ticket NMP-0005: Course search Background
After implementing NMP-0003 it’s possible to see a list of courses based on selecting a subject area.

We’d also like to be able to search for a course based on any of the following critiera:

Subject area
Type (BSc, MA, MSc, etc)
Duration in years by specifying a minimum number of years and a maximum number of years.

A user of the website should be able to enter one or all of the fields above. For example they could select “BSc”, press search and see a list of all the BSc courses. Or choose “Computing” as a subject area, “Type” set to “BSc” and 2 year minimum, 3 year maximum and see all the computing BSc courses that are 2-3 years.

The user should be able to leave any of the criteria blank and select which filters they like

Acceptance criteria

Users can search by type
Users can search by subject area
Users can search by duration
Users can search by entering one, two or all three criteria

Implementation detail

The list of courses in a subject area and list of courses as search results will be very similar. Reuse as much of the subject area page as possible.

Do the searching in the database, filtering records using PHP is much less efficient than the database.

If you’re using an ORM, extend the ORM to allow searching on multiple fields if needed.
























Ticket NMP-0006: Part time courses Background
Some courses can be completed part time. We’d like a way to advertise this on the website.

When adding/editing a course it should be possible to mark the course as having a part time option.

On the public facing website display “Can be completed part time? Yes” or “Can be completed part time? No”
along with displaying the rest of the course information.

The search functionality from NMP-0005 should also be expanded to allow searching for courses that have a part time option

Acceptance criteria

Add an option to mark a course as having a part time option when adding and editing a course
Display whether a course can be completed part time on the course information on the list when clicking the subject area
Display whether a course can be completed part time on the course information on the list in the search results from NMP-0005
Update the search functionality from NMP-0005 with an option to only show courses which can be completed part time


Implementation detail

Update the add/edit functionality for courses to add the new option. We’ll need to make this backward compatible with courses that were added before this change. For existing courses, “part time” can be assume as no, then admins can go ahead and add it in future once the feature is implemented.
















Ticket NMP-0007: Pagination Background
As the website grows and more courses are added, having all the courses in a subject area, or search results page, will end up being a very long page with a lot of results.

For better usability it would be better if these were displayed 10 at a time across different pages (as seen on a lot of websites e.g. google)

When choosing “Computing” it should show the first 10 courses, then page numbers which are clickable. Clicking
page “2” should show courses 11-20, page 3 should show courses

Acceptance criteria

Display 10 courses on the subject area page with a list of page numbers which can be clicked on and navigated to
Add the same pagination to the search results page


Implementation detail

This is a case where combining the subject area list and search result list will make this task a lot easier
if you haven’t done it already.

Make sure to do this in the database, selecting all the records into memory and then grouping them into pages in PHP is very inefficient. Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` in your queries.

For testing this, rather than adding dozens of courses you could set the number of courses per page to 2 instead of 10 and check the page links appear as required. Remember to set the threshold to 10 before finalising the project though.
